        Hey! My name is Hristo. I am a 4th-year Software Engineering student in
        the Netherlands.
      </p>

      <p className="text-textColor subpixel-antialiased text-lg">
        I started my software journey in 2022 with little to no experience.
        Until today, I have learned how to work with many languages, tools, and
        frameworks that are widely used in the industry. I am serious about my
        career development, so I am always eager to learn something new and
        improve my skills.
      </p>

      <p className="text-textColor subpixel-antialiased text-lg">
        Currently, I am looking for an internship that will allow me to grow
        professionally even more and prepare me for the field of software
        engineering after my graduation. I can work both independently and in a
        team setting. If you are looking for a young professional, you are in
        the right place.
      </p>

      <p className="text-textColor subpixel-antialiased text-lg">
        In my free time, I enjoy travelling, doing sports, and going out with
        friends and family.
