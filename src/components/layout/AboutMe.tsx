        Hey! My name is Hristo. I am a 4th-year Software Engineering student in
        the Netherlands.
      </p>

      <p className="text-textColor subpixel-antialiased text-lg">
        I started my journey as a software engineer in 2022 with no experience.
        Until now, I have learned how to work with many languages, tools, and
        frameworks that are widely used in the industry.
      </p>

      <p className="text-textColor subpixel-antialiased text-lg">
        Currently, I am looking for an internship that will help me grow
        professionally and prepare me for the software engineering field after
        my graduation. I am serious about my career development, so I am always
        passionate about learning new skills and improving my current ones.
      </p>

      <p className="text-textColor subpixel-antialiased text-lg">
        In my free time, I enjoy travelling, doing sports and going out with
        friends and family.
