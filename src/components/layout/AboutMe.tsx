        Hey! My name is Hristo. I am a 4th year Software Engineering student in
        the Netherlands. I started my software journey in 2022, with little to
        no experience. Until today, I have learned how to work with many
        languages, tools and frameworks that are widely used in the industry.
        Currently, I am looking for an internship that will allow me to grow
        professionally even more, and prepare me for the field of software
        engineering.In my free time, I enjoy travelling, jogging, and going out
        with friends and family.
