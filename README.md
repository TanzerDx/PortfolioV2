## 👤 About Me

Hey! My name is **Hristo**. I am a 4th-year Software Engineering student in the Netherlands.

I started my software journey in 2022 with little to no experience. Since then, I have learned many languages, tools, and frameworks widely used in the industry. I am passionate about my career development, always eager to learn new things, and continuously improving my skills.

Currently, I am looking for an internship that will allow me to grow professionally and prepare me for a software engineering career after graduation. I can work both independently and in a team setting.

In my free time, I enjoy **travelling, doing sports, and spending time with friends and family**.
